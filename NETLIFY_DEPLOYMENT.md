## 🔧 Netlify Configuration Explained

The `netlify.toml` file we created does:

```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend"              # Where your code is
  command = "npm run build"      # Build command
  publish = ".next"              # What to deploy

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"                    # All routes
  to = "/index.html"             # Go to index (for SPA routing)
  status = 200                   # Return 200, not 404
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Next.js app builds correctly
- ✅ Client-side routing works
- ✅ Direct URL access works (e.g., `/marketplace`)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "Command not found"

**Solution**: Make sure `package.json` has the build script:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build"
  }
}
```

### Pages Return 404

**Solution**: Check `netlify.toml` redirects are configured correctly

### Environment Variables Not Working

**Solution**: 
1. Make sure variables start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
2. Redeploy after adding variables
3. Clear browser cache

### Wallet Connection Shows 403 Error

**Solution**: 
- This is expected without WalletConnect Project ID
- Get free ID from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com)
- Add to Netlify environment variables
- Redeploy

---
