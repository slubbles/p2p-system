Excited to share my latest project: A Universal P2P Marketplace Framework!

Unlike traditional marketplaces (Amazon, Alibaba) that charge 15-40% fees and control everything, this is:

✅ Peer-to-peer (0% platform fees)
✅ Trustless (smart contract escrow)
✅ Open source (anyone can fork)
✅ White-label ready (any industry)

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and designed for Web3.

The vision: Break marketplace monopolies and empower producers.
